* find top artists and songs by state, possibly top 3 of each
* determine by US state 
* provide link to artist website/song based on response
* use US map to allow user to click on state for that state highlight, others dim, and info box pops up with information
* have legend that allows user to switch between artist and song for search
* use current data if possible
* possible heatmap for genres? Will need to check available data
